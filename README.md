# Mortgage Calculator

## How to run

```shell
npm install
```

Builds files from `src/` (JS, SCSS) to `dist/`.


If for some reason install failed, run manually `npm run build` after installing.


To see the application, access `dist/index.html` from a browser.

## Live (development) mode 

```shell
npm run dev
```

Watches for changes inside `src/` files


> **Warning!** probably this won't work on Windows, as it uses a shell pipe (`|`) to launch two processes at the same time. If needed, install and use [`concurrently`](http://npmjs.com/package/concurrently), or the `start` command.

## Run tests

```shell
npm test
```
